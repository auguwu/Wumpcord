# Wumpcord
Flexible, type-safe, and lightweight Discord API library made in TypeScript.

## Example Bot
Coming soon.

## Features
- No over-head with memory: Tired of caching useless things? Wumpcord doesn't cache what you don't need since it's opt-in.
- Command Handling: Tired of using a command handler to add extra dependencies? Wumpcord has that built-in, similar API to discord.js-commando.
- Clustering Support: Tired of adding [clustering](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) to your bot? Wumpcord has clustering support built-in.
- Extra Utilities: Wumpcord bundles in with extra utilities like a Reaction Handler and a Message Collector.
