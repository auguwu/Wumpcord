/**
 * The commands API allows you to create a bot without creating any external command handler.
 * ```js
 * const { commands } = require('wumpcord'); // CommonJS
 * import { commands } from 'wumpcord'; // ESNext
 * ```
 *
 * It's based on **discord.js-commando** and acts kinda similar.
 * We have the concept of "TypeReader"s, which basically validates
 * an argument string to return a different value.
