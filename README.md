# Wumpcord
> :rowboat: **Flexible, type-safe, and lightweight Discord API library made in TypeScript**

## Features
- No over-head with memory: Tired of caching useless things? Wumpcord doesn't cache what you don't need since it's opt-in.
- Command Handling: Tired of using a command handler to add extra dependencies? Wumpcord has that built-in, similar API to discord.js-commando.
- Clustering Support: Tired of build your own [clustering](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) library to your bot? Wumpcord has clustering support built-in with a modular system to plug-in-play methods with IPC and Redis Pub/Sub support.
- Extra Utilities: Wumpcord bundles in with extra utilities like a Reaction Handler and a Message Collector.
